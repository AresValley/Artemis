## :simple-windows: Windows
1. Download the installer `Artemis-Windows-x86_64-4.x.x.exe` in the Assets menu from the [:material-download: LATEST RELEASE](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/releases) and follow the guided procedure to complete the installation process.

## :simple-linux: Linux
1. On Linux, the xcb plugin is utilized to supply the essential functionality required for Qt GUI and Qt Widgets to operate on [X11](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/linux-requirements.html). On some Linux distributions the required dependencies are already met, but in many cases, you will need to install them. To install the dependencies use:

    ``` bash title="Debian-based distro (Ubuntu, Mint, Pop! OS, Kali, ...)"
    sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0
    ```

2. Download `Artemis-Linux-x86_64-4.x.x.tar` in the Assets menu from the [:material-download: LATEST RELEASE](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/releases) and extract the tarball archive in a folder of your choice.
3. Before running `app.bin`, be sure to have the executable permissions to the binary file with:

    ```
    chmod 700 app.bin
    ```

### Create a Shortcut

1. To create a direct shortcut (in the main menu) launch the bash script in the terminal with the command:

    ```
    . create_shortcut.sh
    ```

This script will:

- Set the correct read/write privileges of the Artemis folder
- Create the artemis.desktop file (shortcut) in /home/$USER/.local/share/applications
- Move the Artemis icon file to /usr/share/icons

## :simple-apple: Mac OS
!!! warning
    The macOS support is temporarily limited!

The support for the macOS compiled version of the program is temporarily limited due to a lack of machines for extensive testing. To use Artemis on a macOS device, you have the following options:

* **Run the program directly from the source:** Follow the instructions provided in [this chapter](run_from_source.md) to launch the program from the source code.
* **Compile the Artemis 4 binaries on your machine:** In this case, you can contribute by reporting any issues you encounter by [opening an Issue](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/issues).
* **Use the last available compiled version (3.2.1):** Although this version is no longer officially supported, it remains available for use: [:material-download: Artemis-3.2.1.dmg](https://www.aresvalley.com/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=377).
