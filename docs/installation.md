## :simple-apple: Mac OS
!!! warning
    The macOS support is temporarily limited!

The support for the macOS compiled version of the program is temporarily limited due to a lack of machines for extensive testing. To use Artemis on a macOS device, you have the following options:

* **Run the program directly from the source:** Follow the instructions provided in [this chapter](run_from_source.md) to launch the program from the source code.
* **Compile the Artemis 4 binaries on your machine:** In this case, you can contribute by reporting any issues you encounter by [opening an Issue](https://github.com/AresValley/Artemis/issues).
* **Use the last available compiled version (3.2.1):** Although this version is no longer officially supported, it remains available for use: [:material-download: Artemis-3.2.1.dmg](https://aresvalley.com/download/11/).
