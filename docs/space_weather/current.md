## 1. Kp Index
The **K index** is a number (from 0 to 9) that shows how much Earth's magnetic field is disturbed. A K index of 1 means things are calm, while a K index of 5 or higher indicates a geomagnetic storm. These disturbances are measured with magnetometers that track changes in Earth's magnetic field every three hours. The K itself comes from a German word "Kennziffer" meaning "characteristic digit". To get a big picture of what's happening around the world, an official planetary **Kp index** is calculated. This is done by averaging the K indices from a special network of 13 geomagnetic observatories located around the globe at mid-latitudes.

|Index|Activity Level|High Latitudes|Low Latitudes|Possible Source|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Kp 0**|Inactive|Weak & slow aurora possible|Aurora extremely unlikely|Small influx of particles due to some reconnections mostly at the magnetotail|
|**Kp 1**|Very Quiet|Weak & slow aurora likely|Aurora very unlikely|Vide supra|
|**Kp 2**|Quiet|Moderate auroral display|Aurora unlikely|Vide supra|
|**Kp 3**|Unsettled|Active auroral display, sporadic substorm possible|Weak aurora display possible|Coronal hole sending fast winds or remains after days of storming, enhanced solar wind|
|**Kp 4**|Active|Active auroral display, multiple sporadic substorms possible|Weak Aurora Display Possible|Vide supra|
|**Kp 5**|Minor Storm (G1)|Very active auroral display, multiple substorms likely|Aurora display likely|Coronal hole sending fast winds or coronal mass ejection (CME), enhanced solar wind|
|**Kp 6**|Moderate Storm (G2)|Strong auroral display, longer substorms|Active auroral display very likely|Vide supra|
|**Kp 7**|Strong Storm (G3)|Very strong auroral display|Strong auroral display extremely likely|Large CMEs caused by solar storms or flares, very enhanced solar wind with strong shock wave|
|**Kp 8**|Severe Storm (G4)|Extremely strong aurora, long periods of substorming|Strong auroral display extremely likely|Vide supra|
|**Kp 9**|Extreme Storm (G5)|Extremely strong aurora, long periods of substorming|Very strong auroral display, overhead aurora possible|Super CMEs, Carrington-class events, devastating solar wind with extreme shock waves|

## 2. Ap Index
The **A index** represents the three-hourly equivalent amplitude of geomagnetic activity at a specific magnetometer station, derived from the station-specific K index. Due to the quasi-logarithmic nature of the K-scale in relation to magnetometer fluctuations, directly averaging a set of K indices is not really meaningful. Instead each K is converted back into a linear scale. The **Ap index** is determined by averaging the eight daily Ap values (3-hour) and using the same stations grid explained for the Kp index in the previous section. This provides a measure of geomagnetic activity for a specific day. Days with higher levels of geomagnetic activity correspond to higher daily Ap values.

## 4. X-Ray Solar Activity
This is a summary of the **X-Ray Flare Class**. Large solar X-ray flares can change the Earth’s ionosphere, which blocks high-frequency (HF) radio transmissions on the sunlit side of the Earth. Solar flares are also associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) which can ultimately lead to geomagnetic storms. SWPC sends out space weather alerts at the M5 level. Some large flares are accompanied by strong radio bursts that may interfere with other radio frequencies and cause problems for satellite communication and radio navigation (GPS).

| Class | Peak Strength (W/m<sup>2</sup>) | Effects on Earth                                             |
|-------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| B     | I < 10<sup>-6</sup>             | Too small to harm Earth                                      |
| C     | 10<sup>-6</sup> ≤ I < 10<sup>-5</sup> | Small with few noticeable consequences                 |
| M     | 10<sup>-5</sup> ≤ I < 10<sup>-4</sup> | Brief radio blackouts in polar regions, minor radiation storms |
| X     | I ≥ 10<sup>-4</sup>             | Planet-wide radio blackouts, long-lasting radiation storms |

## 5. RF Propagation

### Maximum Usable Frequency
In radio transmission, the maximum usable frequency (MUF) is the highest frequency that can be effectively used for communication between two locations on Earth by reflecting off the ionosphere (via skywave or skip) at a given time, regardless of the transmitter's power. This measurement is particularly valuable for shortwave transmissions.

### Earth-Moon-Earth
Earth–Moon–Earth communication (EME), commonly referred to as Moon bounce, is a radio communication method in which radio waves are transmitted from an Earth-based station, reflected off the Moon's surface, and then received back on Earth. The value gives the probability of a succesfull connection.

### Meteor Scatter
Meteor burst communications (MBC), also known as meteor scatter (MS) communications, is a radio propagation technique that uses the ionized trails created by meteors entering the atmosphere to establish brief communication links between radio stations up to 2,250 kilometers (1,400 miles) apart. This can involve either forward-scatter or back-scatter of the radio waves. Like EME, the value gives the probability of a succesfull connection.

### Sporadic-E
**Report of the latest E-skip spots on 50, 70 & 144 MHz by [DXrobot](https://dxrobot.gooddx.net/)**

Sporadic E (Es or SpE) is a rare type of radio propagation that uses a lower part of the Earth's ionosphere, which typically doesn't refract radio waves. It reflects signals off small "clouds" in the E region at altitudes of 95-150 km (50-100 miles). Unlike the regular F region skywave propagation, which depends on daily cycles of ionized layers from UV light, Sporadic E uses transient ionized patches. This allows for occasional long-distance VHF communication, usually during the six weeks around the summer solstice, beyond the normal line-of-sight range.

### Aurora Spots
**Report of the latest aurora spots on 50, 70 & 144 MHz by [DXrobot](https://dxrobot.gooddx.net/)**

Auroral propagation, or auroral backscatter, is a form of radio propagation that occurs during an auroral event, affecting VHF and UHF communications. Increased ionization in the E layer of the ionosphere reflects signals at much higher frequencies than usual, enabling communication up to 1000 MHz, though 500 MHz is more common. Signals are directed towards the auroral region and reflected back, but they are often distorted due to particle movement (the signal is roughly Doppler shifted of 1 kHz at around 150 MHz as the electrons stream down).

### Expected HF Noise
This is just the expected noise in HF based on the current Space Weather conditions.
