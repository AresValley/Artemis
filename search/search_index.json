The cross-correlation function, commonly defined as a sliding inner (dot) product, quantifies the similarity between two signals as a function of a temporal shift applied to one of them:</p> \\[ \\left[ k*l \\right]\\equiv \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}k^{*}(t)l(t+\\tau)dt \\] <p>where \\(k\\) and \\(l\\) are two general non-discrete functions without discontinuity, \\(k^{*}\\) is the complex conjugate of \\(k\\) and \\(\\tau\\) is the lag (time delay for signal analysis). This representation is closely related to the convolution theorem by the following relationship:</p> \\[ k(t)*l(t)\\equiv k^{*}(-t)*l(t) \\] <p>In our case, the signal must be compared with itself to identify periodic patterns or detect anomalous high degrees of similarity within a given time interval. To achieve this objective, we can employ the Autocorrelation Function (ACF), which is essentially the cross-correlation of a signal with itself, where \\(k(t)=l(t)\\). The following equation defines the ACF, derived from a straightforward modification of the initial equation:</p> \\[ \\left[ k*k \\right](\\tau)\\equiv \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}k^{*}(t)k(t+\\tau)dt \\] <p>Within a discrete data set composed by \\(Y(t)\\) records we can easily calculate autocorrelation from:</p> \\[ \\rho_{\\tau}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N-\\tau}(Y_i-\\bar{Y})(Y_{i+\\tau}-\\bar{Y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(Y_i-\\bar{Y})^2} \\] <p>where \\(Y_{i+\u03c4}\\) is a lagged data by \\(\u03c4\\) of \\(Y_i\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}\\) is the average value of the original data set. Entire denominator is used to keep the normalization condition, indeed \u03c1\u03c4 can assume a value between -1 (exact anticorrelation) and +1 (exact correlation). A complete correlation can be only achieved with a perfect overlap of the analyzed function with it self; the simple way to verify that is when \\(\u03c4=0\\)</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"acf_analysis/#example-acf-analysis","title":"Example: ACF Analysis","text":""},{"location":"acf_analysis/#stanag-4285","title":"STANAG 4285","text":"<p>The first example will be a NATO standard known as STANAG 4285.
